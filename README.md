# Python Foundations 🚀

This repository contains my **Python fundamentals learning journey**, where I am strengthening my core concepts by **learning each topic and solving practice questions** related to it.

I am currently a beginner, but I am committed to building **strong foundations in Python**, which will help me move confidently into **advanced Python, AI/ML, and GenAI development**.

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

- Learn Python **from basics to core concepts**
- Practice questions for **each topic/module**
- Write clean and understandable code
- Build confidence through **hands-on learning**
- Gradually add **mini-projects** to solidify concepts

This repository acts as my **personal practice notebook + progress tracker**.

## 📂 Topics Covered So Far

Each file focuses on one core Python concept with examples and solved questions:

- `basic.py` → Python basics (syntax, variables, input/output)
- `conditional.py` → if-else, logical conditions
- `loop.py` → for loops, while loops, pattern logic
- `functions.py` → functions, parameters, return values
- `list_tuple.py` → lists, tuples, indexing, operations
- `strings.py` → string manipulation and methods
- `sets_dict.py` → sets and dictionaries
- `file_IO.py` → file handling (read/write)
- `oop.py` → object-oriented programming basics (classes & objects)

## 🛠️ How I Am Learning

For every topic, I follow this approach:

1. Learn the concept properly
2. Solve beginner-level questions
3. Practice logic-building problems
4. Revisit and improve code
5. Apply concepts in small projects

## 🧩 Future Plans

- Complete **all Python fundamentals**
- Add **mini-projects** (games, utilities, logic-based programs)
- Improve code quality and structure
- Move towards **Data Structures, AI/ML, and GenAI**
- Convert this foundation into **resume-worthy projects**
